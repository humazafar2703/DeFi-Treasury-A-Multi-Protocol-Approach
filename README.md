This project focuses on designing and implementing a decentralized finance (DeFi) treasury system using smart contracts. It enables the efficient management of digital assets across various DeFi protocols and liquidity pools such as Uniswap and Aave.

Key Features:

Multi-Protocol Interactions: The treasury smart contract can interact with multiple DeFi protocols, enabling the distribution of funds across these platforms.

Support for Stable Coins: The system is designed to receive and manage stable coins like USDC. It also supports swapping of funds for other stable coins like USDT or DAI in case of a liquidity pool.

Dynamic Allocation: The allocation of funds to different protocols can be set by the contract owner and changed dynamically even after deployment to the Ethereum network.

Withdrawal Management: The contract allows for both full and partial withdrawal of funds from the liquidity pools or DeFi protocols.

Yield Aggregation: The system can calculate the aggregated percentage yield of all the connected protocols.

This project aims to make managing funds across multiple DeFi protocols easier, more efficient, and dynamic, offering flexibility and control over asset management in DeFi spaces.
