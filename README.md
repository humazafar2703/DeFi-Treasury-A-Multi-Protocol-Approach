The project is focused on designing and implementing a decentralized finance (DeFi) treasury system using smart contracts.

The system enables efficient management of digital assets across various DeFi protocols and liquidity pools (e.g., Uniswap and Aave).

Key features of the system include:
    Multi-Protocol Interactions: The treasury smart contract can interact with multiple DeFi protocols, which allows the distribution of funds across these platforms.
    Support for Stable Coins: The system is designed to receive and manage stable coins like USDC. In the case of a liquidity pool, it also supports swapping of funds 
                              for other stable coins like USDT or DAI.
    Dynamic Allocation: The allocation of funds to different protocols can be set by the contract owner and can be changed dynamically even after deployment to the    
                        Ethereum network.
    Withdrawal Management: The contract provides the capability for both full and partial withdrawal of funds from the liquidity pools or DeFi protocols.
    Yield Aggregation: The system has the capability to calculate the aggregated percentage yield of all the connected protocols.

The project aims to simplify the management of funds across multiple DeFi protocols, making it more efficient and dynamic.

It provides flexibility and control over asset management in DeFi spaces.
